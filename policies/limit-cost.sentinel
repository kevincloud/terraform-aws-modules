# This policy uses the Sentinel tfrun import to restrict the
# proposed monthly cost that would be incurred if the current
# plan were applied

##### Imports #####

import "tfrun"
import "decimal"

##### Functions #####

# Validate that the proposed monthly cost is less than the limit
limit_proposed_monthly_cost = func(limit) {

  # Determine proposed monthly cost
  proposed_cost = decimal.new(tfrun.cost_estimate.proposed_monthly_cost)

  # Compare proposed monthly cost to the limit
  if proposed_cost.lte(limit) {
    print("Proposed monthly cost", proposed_cost.string,
          "is under the limit:", limit.string)
    return true
  } else {
    print("Proposed monthly cost", proposed_cost.string,
          "is over the limit:", limit.string)
    return false
  }
}

##### Monthly Limit #####
limit = decimal.new(15)

##### Rules #####
cost_validated = limit_proposed_monthly_cost(limit)
